#Purpose from CD team:

This is where students put everything they have learned so far in Mod 2 together in preparation for the project.

#Homework

Every great captain, whether on the waters or in the skies, keeps a daily log.

Let's build the perfect Captain's Log App for our extraordinary captains.

There are many ways to get started building an app. This lab follows a specific order for two reasons:

    to align with the content of lecture
    to give you an order to guide you to create small bits of functionality and test each one before moving on to the next part

#SUPER BONUS

- Once you finish this whole lab, add a second model for comments, it should have the name of the person who wrote it, and some text for the comment (maybe time stamps?). This model should 'belong' the the post, the data should be related in some way. Do you own research of how to set up a one-to-many relationship (one post can have many comments, one comment only belongs to one post), in MongoDB. Use Mongo Documentation, or Google.
